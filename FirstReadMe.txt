-------Project#4 ReadMe.txt

Important: Please start up project as Administrator. You can start run.bat directly, 
           I have set the administrator level(You need click Yes).

1. You can open the Server and Two Wpfclients by runing TestLauncher program directly.

2. The Req#8 part in the WPFReadClient will not run automatically, because this part will cost more time 
   than else. It is better to run it manually.

3. All other parts in two Wpf will run automatically you can check the results in Demo parts of two Wpf, 
   which demonstrate requirements I have met.

4. DataBase.xml, Persist.xml, Query.xml and Restore.xml are in the root file, while other xml file are in 
   the Bin file of the Server.
 
5. As for the Req#10, TestLauncherprovides commandline "-R x"and "-W y" to determine the number of the Writers
   and Readers.(I set x and y both are 1, you can change it as you wish.)

6. I love C#.
